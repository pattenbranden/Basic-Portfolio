            <p><strong>Hi, I'm Branden, an aspiring Web Dev from South West Florida!</strong></p>
            <p>I'm a dedicated learner. I will pour countless hours into a project until I understand it inside and out. As my parent's said to me when growing up, "Never stop learning!" </p>
            <p>The majority of my work experience has been in the service industry. Web development seemed like an amazing oppourtunity to escape, and I am enthusiastic to continue growing in this field. So far, I'm only a fledgling, but I keep working hard, I know my work will shine like none-other.</p>
